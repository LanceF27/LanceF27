Hello, all. I'm David and am excited to be in this class.
I am currently in my last year at SCC, on the Programming/Database IT track. 
I am learning advanced C#, Java, and SQL this semester.
I love to make 2d game projects as a hobby. Generating 2d game assets is my greatest strength but I am working to be a better programmer.
I am also trying to learn about using blender for 3d modeling.
I hope to get into a career in IT, with the additional goal of making a game project worthy of publishing.
